Project 3 - Instagrid:

In this GitHub website you will see a one-page website that allows any user to
search a hashtag using Instagram's API. Once the images are called, they will
appear on the website in a grid format depending on the device size.

To create this website I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, RWD (with a mobile first approach),
flexbox, AJAX and JSON requests from Instagram's API, Gulp, and Git and GitHub!

I really enjoyed this project, it was really interesting and fun to pull data
from Instagrams API and display that data on your website. I know that will be
very useful to know in the future. Having the photo's display the way I wanted to
was the hardest part for me, and I still plan to continue to fix that issue so my site
looks exactly like the Test-Site Mandi created.
